# Fun with AST

Provides developers with a programmatic tool to change our own code.
This repository contains a library to analyze and manipulate python code
using [Abstract Systax Tress](https://docs.python.org/3/library/ast.html) manipulation.
## Using the library

See the [test-fun-with-ast](https://github.com/shairubin/test-fun-with-ast) project for examples of using the
fun-with-ast library.

## Why Fun-with-AST

1. Here is
   a [talk](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/e/2PACX-1vQTQQNaUPs7UNO_skE5vxBxaYbu6box99g_DnYYOuXuIKUqxI-_XEMxQ3p0_CBNlE6V9F3NzpOaXzUJ/pub?start=true&loop=false&delayms=30000)
   I gave in Pycon 2023. It explains the capabilities of fun-with-ast.
2. It is a great learning personal development experience.
3. Enables smart and complex manipulations

## Examples: AST Parse vs. AST Unparse vs. fun-with-ast Source Code Preserver

The examples below show an original program that first was unparsed with
python ast module,
and then was unparsed using the fun-with-ast library. The actual code that generates
these example can be found in the [test-fun-with-ast](https://github.com/shairubin/test-fun-with-ast)
library.

## Potential usages:

- Fun #1: Keep source to source transformations
- Fun #2: switch `else` / `if` bodies
- Fun #3: mutation testing switch `<` into `<=`
- Fun #4: Switch `For` to `While`
- Fun #5: for loop into tail recursion.
- Fun #7: Add node AND comment.

## How to Contribute

1. Follow the steps
   in  [Contribute to projects](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/quickstart/contributing-to-projects).
2. You can chose an existing open issue or open a new one.
3. Start working ....
4. Before submitting a pull request make sure tests are [passing](#how-to-run-tests).

## How to Run Tests

1. In `fun-with-ast` we use pytest.
2. Use your IDE to run all tests in `tests` directory.
3. OR, use command line:
    1. `cd <your path to fun-with-ast fork>/fun_with_ast/tests`
    2. `pytest --version`, should be at least `7.2.2`
    3. run `pytest`
    4. No tests should fail - some tests would be skipped / xfail.

## Limitations

1. The library is not yet mature.
2. Determining the the of quote (i.e., ' or ") for each string is done at the module or node level.
   If a node contains both `print('fun-with-ast')` and `print("fun-with-ast")` only one of them will be
   preserved,
   the first one in the module/node. (See method `guess_default_quote_for_node`, if you want to work on something
   interesting)
